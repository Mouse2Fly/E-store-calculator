change the "your results" table border color to a lighter green
2 minutes ago

I'll change the results table border color to a lighter green shade.

Perfect! I've changed the results table borders to a lighter green color (#8bc9b3). Let me restart the server to show you the update:

Excellent! The server is running. Let me take a screenshot to show you the lighter green borders:

Perfect! ✅ I've changed the results table borders to a lighter, softer green color (#8bc9b3).
Updated Results Table Borders:

    Outer border: Now light green instead of dark green
    Row separators: Light green for a softer look
    Column dividers: Light green to match

The lighter green provides a more subtle, elegant look while still complementing the dark green (#2d5650) used in the buttons and section numbers. The table will still have the alternating row colors (white and light gray) for easy reading.

When you fill out the calculator and click "CALCULATE", you'll see the results table with these beautiful lighter green borders that create a softer, more approachable design while maintaining the bebetono.lt aesthetic!
